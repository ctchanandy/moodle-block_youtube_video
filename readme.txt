Moodle Youtube Video Playlist Block v1.0
Paul Holden, Greenhead College [pholden@greenhead.ac.uk]

This block allows you to create video playlists using videos which are hosted on Youtube.

Each instance of the block that you add to a course contains its own playlist. Within this
playlist you can create as many videos as you wish, or add videos that have been shared by
other courses. When displaying the block, one of the videos will be randomly chosen from
the playlist and played.

Note: when adding new videos the URL field refers to the URL that is displayed in your
browser address bar on the Youtube website, and must conform to the following format:

	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IfH6dYZLzE

Please read install.txt for installation instructions.

Tested in Moodle version 1.7.1
